## Team Strategy

Porscha came up with the idea and over the weeks the other team members joined. 

We incorporated agile and Microsoft OneNote tools to move our project along. From start to finish, we made notes each sesssion about the progress that was done and created goals for the next session.

Our early team meetings were focused on coming up with the design and layout of the website. After they were drawn, we agreed to mob program certain pages to keep pages, themes, languages, and colors consistent. Unfortunately, for data purposes, we could not find an API that lists festivals in Atlanta, if any exists. Instead, we found festivals through google searches and put their information into a database using Sequel Pro. Along, the way we individually contributed to pages to accomplish new tasks that arised and to fill in gaps in our plans.

Once the product was completed, we uploaded it to our Amazon Web Servers for your viewing pleasure.


Site Walkthrough

Home Page

Our home page brings the user directly to features the user would want to access right away such as link to all the festivals listed, which can then be narrowed down on the next page. In the event the user knows what the user wants, it also allows them to quickly narrow their search by picking a category. The home page has several other features like social media buttons that can be used to share this page.

Category Page
Each category has its own page. Users can refine their search by searching for festival names, entering a range date, selecting family-friendly events, or selecting free events.

All Festivals Pages

We also provided a page containing all the festivals for the user who simply does not know what kind of festival a user wishes to attend.
